1. Trees (Foundations)

Focus on:
* DFS (recursive and iterative)
* BFS (level-order traversal)
* Binary Search Tree (BST) properties
* Inorder, Preorder, Postorder
* Height, Diameter, Symmetry, Balance
* Lowest Common Ancestor
* Path problems (sum paths, longest path, etc.)
* Serialization/deserialization (LeetCode 297)

Key problems to start:
* 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
* 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal
* 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree
* 110. Balanced Binary Tree
* 543. Diameter of Binary Tree
* 236. Lowest Common Ancestor
* 124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
* 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
